##How to change order of tasks?
Changing order of tasks within a list is possible. Select a list first and click the "View" icon on top right corner of the middle panel. Then, you can choose to sort tasks by due dates, by title, by order and by priority.

If you choose "by title", tasks will be ordered alphabetically. If you choose "by order", then, you can drag tasks to manually change their order per your own preferences. But manually changing order is not applicable to the "All", “Today" & "Next 7 days" lists.
