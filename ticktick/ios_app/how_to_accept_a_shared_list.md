### How to accept a shared list?
If someone shares a list with you, you will get a notification inside TickTick.

Slide the screen to the right, and you will find a Mail-shaped icon on the top right of the screen. The number on the Mail-shaped icon counts the number of notifications. After clicking the “Mail” to accept a shared list, it will be automatically created as a list in TickTick.
