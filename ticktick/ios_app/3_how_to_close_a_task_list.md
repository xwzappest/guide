### 3. How to close a task list?
In order to keep the interface clean and improve app performance, you can close inactive task lists. Slide the screen to the right first. Then, click “Edit” and choose a task list. On the next page, click on “close”. Please note after closing a list, tasks within that list will not be displayed in “All”, “Today” and “Next 7 days”. In addition, tasks of closed lists won’t be reminded any more.
