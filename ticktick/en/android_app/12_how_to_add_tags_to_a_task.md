### 12. How to add “Tags” to a task?
The “Tags” list is hidden by default. So, you should first show it by editing the lists. Then, you can start creating tasks by adding the “#” symbol in front of any word or phrase. And you can attach at most 5 tags to each task. When clicking on the “Tags”, you will be directed to the list, where all tasks labeled by this tag will be displayed.
