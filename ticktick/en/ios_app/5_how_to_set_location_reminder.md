### 5. How to set “location reminder”?
Choose a task and click the “...” menu on top right corner to tap the “location”. Then, a map will be automatically loaded where you can choose the address to be reminded either upon arrival or leaving. If you don’t want to choose the address in the map, you can also enter the address for search. To ensure proper work of “location reminder”, you should make sure that Settings>Privacy>Location Services is enabled and TickTick location service is also enabled.
