### How to accept a shared list?
If someone shares a list with you, you will get a notification inside TickTick.

1.Slide the screen to the right from margin or click the bulleted list icon on the top left of the toolbar.

2.You will find a Mail-shaped icon on the top right of the screen.

The number on the Mail-shaped icon counts the number of notifications/shared lists. After clicking the “Mail” to accept a shared list, it will be automatically created as a list.
