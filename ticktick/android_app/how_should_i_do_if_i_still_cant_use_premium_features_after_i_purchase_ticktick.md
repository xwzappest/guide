## How should I do if I still can't use premium features after I purchase TickTick?
Upon completion of your payment, normally you can enjoy premium features, but if you still are not allowed to use them, you should restore TickTick.

Slide the screen to the right from margin or click the bulleted list icon on the top left of the toolbar and then click your account name to enter account details. Next, you can click "Restore" at the bottom of the page.
