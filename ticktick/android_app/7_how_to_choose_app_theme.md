## How to change the theme?
At present, TickTick has two different themes, light and dark. You can slide the screen to the right from margin or click the bulleted list icon on the top left of the toolbar and then click the gear-shaped icon on the top right corner. After that, click “More” and then click “Theme” to choose your preferred theme.
