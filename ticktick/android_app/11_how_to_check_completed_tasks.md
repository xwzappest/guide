## How to check completed tasks?
You can track all completed & archived tasks in completed list. The completed list is hidden by default, you can enable it by “Edit List” (turn to 2.3.1 for details).

Tasks in “Completed” has been sorted by completion date, and you can choose to view all completed tasks in a specific list by clicking the icon of "funnel" on the top right of the page.
