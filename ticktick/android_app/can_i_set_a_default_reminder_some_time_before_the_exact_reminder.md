# How to set a default reminder time before the exact reminder?
If you want to be reminded one day before the due date or 1 hour before the reminder, you can set default reminder time before the exact reminder.

You can slide the screen to the right from margin or click the bulleted list icon on the top left of the toolbar and click the gear-shaped icon on the top right corner. After that, click “New Task Default”, and then click “Default reminder time” to choose to be reminded on time orsome time earlier.
