## How to voice input tasks?
You can voice input tasks via “note to self” & “Set Alarm” voice command. You should first ensure that your phone is equipped with Google Now. With that, simply hit the microphone icon of the Google search box on the top of your home screen. Start by saying “note to self” followed by your task and Google will decipher the text automatically. Then, a pop-up window will appear, asking you to save the task to TickTick for once or always.

For “Set Alarm” command, start by saying “Set Alarm” followed by Time+Task and a task will be created with a reminder time.
