# 4. How to generate and import backup?
Click the avatar on top right corner to enter "Settings" > "Account". Then, click "Generate Backup" and the button will be changed to "download" so that you can export backup in a .json file.

If you need import backup later, you can click "import backup" to upload the previously downloaded file.
