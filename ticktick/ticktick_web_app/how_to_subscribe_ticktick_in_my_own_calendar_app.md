# How to subscribe TickTick in my own calendar app?
TickTick allows you to display tasks in your own Calendar apps. Click the avatar on top right corner to enter “Settings” > “Calendar Subscription”. Click “Enable” and then, you will get a URL. Clicking on that URL will open your default calendar application directly.
