##How to close an inactive list temporarily?
Closing inactive lists can keep interface concise and improve performance.

Click the downward arrow of a list to choose “close” and click “OK” for confirmation.

Once a list is closed, tasks of this list will not be displayed in “All”, “Today”, “Next 7 Days” and search results. In addition, tasks of this list will not be reminded anymore.
