## 10. Mail Service
In addition to creating tasks via web, you can also create tasks via email. Click the avatar on top right  corner to enter “Settings” > “Mail Service” and you will find a designated email address. Send an email with your tasks to that address and it will be converted as to-do’s in your TickTick account automatically. Or, you can email your tasks to [todo@mail.ticktick.com]( todo@mail.ticktick.com) with your TickTick registered email address directly.
The subject of the email will be the name of the task and the content of the email will be the subtasks. Also you add date and reminder time for the task. For example, you can write “Go to Starbucks with Frank tomorrow 4pm” in the subject, then you will find this task in TickTick’s “Inbox” with due date (tomorrow) and reminder time (4 pm).
