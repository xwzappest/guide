##Mail Service
In addition to creating tasks via web, you can also create tasks via email. Click the avatar on top right  corner to enter “Settings” > “Mail Service” and you will find a designated email address. Send an email with your tasks to that address and it will be converted as to-do’s in your TickTick account automatically. Or, you can email your tasks to [todo@mail.ticktick.com]( todo@mail.ticktick.com) with your TickTick registered email address directly.
