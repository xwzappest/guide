# What shortcuts can I use in TickTick ?
You can view all shortcuts that can be used in TickTick. Click the avatar on top right corner to enter “More” > “Shortcuts”.

For example, if you want to add a new task, you can use shortcuts to add task's due date and its certain list directly. You can enter “Go to Party^Fun*Tuesday”, then you will find a new task “Go to party” with due date on Tuesday, and it is in the list “Fun”.
