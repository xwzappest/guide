##How to delete my account?
Click the avatar on top right corner to enter “Settings” > “Account”. Then, click “Delete account”. Please note deleting account will remove all data from TickTick and therefore, for cautious purpose, you will be asked to enter your password for confirmation. If you've forgotten your password, you are suggested to reset your password first.
